# Location Tracking API

A clean, scalable, production-grade **NestJS** backend to manage **locations with tags**, supporting:

- PostgreSQL + Prisma ORM
- RESTful CRUD APIs
- Real-time WebSocket updates (`newLocation`)
- Atomic transactions for location creation
- In-memory caching layer
- DTO validation via `class-validator`
- Modular, clean architecture

---

## Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Project

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/location-service.git
cd location-service
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Setup Environment

Create a `.env` file at the project root:

```env
PORT=3000
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:password@localhost:5432/location_db
```

### 4. Run Prisma

```bash
npx prisma generate
npx prisma migrate dev --name init
```

### 5. Start the Server

```bash
npm run start:dev

## WebSocket

The app broadcasts newly created locations to all clients using a WebSocket event:

- **Event name**: `newLocation`
- **Payload**: full location object including `mapUrl` and tags
